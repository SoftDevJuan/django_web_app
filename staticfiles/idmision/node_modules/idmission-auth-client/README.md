# IDmission Auth Client for NodeJS

This package allows NodeJS applications to generate tokens for use with IDmission technology.

## Basic Usage

```bash
npm i idmission-auth-client
```

Set the following environment variables in your server's runtime environment:

```bash
export IDMISSION_AUTH_HOST="https://auth.idmission.com"
export IDMISSION_CLIENT_ID="your-idmission-client-id"
export IDMISSION_CLIENT_SECRET="your-idmission-client-secret"
export IDMISSION_USERNAME="your-idmission-username"
export IDMISSION_PASSWORD="your-idmission-password"
```

New customers receive their token generation credentials via email. If you haven't received them, reach out to support@idmission.com.

To generate a token in your server-side application code:

```typescript
import { IDmissionTokenGenerator } from "idmission-auth-client";

const token = await new IDmissionTokenGenerator().generate()
```
